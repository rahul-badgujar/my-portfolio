      "description":
          '''Hello connections, I recently heard a lot of good stuff about Google Firebase, and I planned a project out of curiosity in learning Firebase. Now it's ready after 3 weeks of coding. This is an application (EShopee) built using FlutterFire (Flutter+Firebase) for eCommerce. In this application, I have tried to gather all the fundamental features of any eCommerce app. It uses Flutter Framework for the Frontend and Backend of the App and Firebase as a server to maintain the app's databases and storage requirements.
While creating this application, I learned about the following Firebase features:
1. Firebase Authentification
2. Firebase Cloud Firestore
3. Firebase Storage
In addition to this, I also gained more experience in designing Stable Apps with Provider State Management Package with Flutter Framework. I have also developed knowledge of writing and modulating source codes for maintenance.

Give a try to the Application: http://bit.ly/EShopee-APK
